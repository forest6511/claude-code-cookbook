# Recipe 27: Referencing Framework Documentation with Context7 MCP

Looking up framework documentation in a browser and then returning to Claude Code is inefficient. Claude Code's training data has a knowledge cutoff, so it can't reference the latest API changes or newly released features.

## Files

- `.mcp.json` — Context7 MCP server configuration with API key

## Book Reference

See Chapter 5 of *Claude Code Cookbook* for the full recipe.
