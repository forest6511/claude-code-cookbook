# Recipe 94: Issue-Driven Development Workflow

You're manually assembling the Issue-to-branch-to-implementation-to-PR flow every time. You want a single command that handles the full cycle.

## Files

- `.claude/skills/work-issue/SKILL.md` — Skill that reads a GitHub Issue, creates a branch, implements, and opens a PR
- `.claude/skills/list-issues/SKILL.md` — Skill that lists open issues sorted by priority labels

## Book Reference

See Chapter 15 of *Claude Code Cookbook* for the full recipe.
