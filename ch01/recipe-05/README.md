# Recipe 05: Configuring settings.json

You're running Claude Code with default settings and missing out on model selection, permission management, and MCP server auto-approval that could streamline your workflow.

## Files

- `user-settings.json` — User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`): personal safety net with schema, permissions, and turn duration
- `.claude/settings.json` — Project settings: team-shared permissions and MCP auto-approval
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — Local settings: personal model override and environment variables

## Book Reference

See Chapter 1 of *Claude Code Cookbook* for the full recipe.
