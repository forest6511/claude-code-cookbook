You're manually running Git commands between Claude Code interactions, breaking your flow for branch creation, commits, and PR submissions.

## Files

- `CLAUDE.md` — Git workflow conventions (branch naming, Conventional Commits, pre-PR checks)
- `.claude/settings.json` — Combined allow and deny permissions for Git and GitHub CLI operations

## Book Reference

See Chapter 3 of *Claude Code Cookbook* for the full recipe.
