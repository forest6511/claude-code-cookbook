# Recipe 46: Building a Documentation Generation Skill

Documentation falls behind code changes. READMEs, API docs, and code comments become stale.

## Files

- `.claude/skills/generate-readme/SKILL.md` — README.md generation from source code analysis
- `.claude/skills/generate-docs/SKILL.md` — JSDoc/docstring generation for code files

## Book Reference

See Chapter 8 of *Claude Code Cookbook* for the full recipe.
