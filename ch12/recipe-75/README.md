# Recipe 75: Configure Agent Teams with Flags

Creating agent files for one-time tasks is tedious. You need agents defined programmatically for scripts and CI/CD.

## Files

- `agents-config.json` -- Example JSON config for use with `claude --agents "$(cat agents-config.json)"`

## Book Reference

See Chapter 12 of *Claude Code Cookbook* for the full recipe.
