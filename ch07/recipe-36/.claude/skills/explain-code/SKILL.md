description: Explain how code works using diagrams and analogies. Use when asked "how does this work?" or "explain this code."

When explaining code, follow this structure:

1. **One-line summary**: What this code does
2. **Analogy**: Relate the logic to something familiar
3. **ASCII diagram**: Visualize data flow or structure
4. **Step-by-step trace**: Walk through execution
5. **Common pitfalls**: Mistakes to watch for with this pattern
